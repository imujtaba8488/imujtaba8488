Hello! I am Syed Mujtaba Nazki and I am a Flutter Developer. I have been developing professionally for 10+ years but tinkering since a kid.

I started out with Flutter when it was still in its inception. Since then, it has become my primary choice for Application Development. As of today, I stand with 5+ years of hands-on experience with Flutter and a track record of developing several enterprise level Mobile applications both for Android and iOS platform ranging from a simple time-tracking app to a complex data-driven App. One of my future goals include utilizing the power of Flutter on other Platforms such as Web and Desktop and dive early into Google's upcoming Fuchsia Operating System.

I would like to define myself as a result-driven and accomplished Software Engineer, effective leader and team player with exceptional analytical and critical thinking skills and the important ability to solve complex problems.
